            There are many places you could visit first, however a popular choice is the fabled Big Ben. 
            <br>
            Big Ben is located in Westminster, London and is next to the River Thames.
            <br>
            A common misconception about Big Ben is that it is the tower itself. 
            However, this is not true, as Big Ben is actually the clock within the tower!
